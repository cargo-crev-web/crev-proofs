# Proof Repository

This git repository is a [Crev Proof Repository](https://github.com/crev-dev/crev/wiki/Proof-Repository).

<!-- Feel free to customize this file below this line -->

cargo_crev_web is a web app for querying crev reviews.
It is in beta testing. A simple example of use:
https://bestia.dev/cargo_crev_web/query/num-traits

This repo contains the list of trusted developers.
Only their repos and repos of their trusted developers will be used.
I will try to make it as broad as possible. The goal is to have most reviews in here.
But I must avoid the possibility of a malicious repo. So now I have this white-list approach.
Comments and sugestions are appreciated.
